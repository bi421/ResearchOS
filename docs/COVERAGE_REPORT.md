### Strong Coverage (>90%)

The following modules have excellent test coverage and serve as **REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS**:

- `objects/macro.py` — **100%** (562 lines)
- `objects/market_memory.py` — **100%** (287 lines)
- `core/identity.py` — **100%** (113 lines)
- `evidence/` package (all modules 95%+) — Evidence emission layer fully tested
- `decision_engine/action_generator.py` — **100%** (89 lines)
- `reasoning_engine/` package — 96%+ coverage
- All frozen core contracts (decision, experiment, result, etc.) — 95%+ coverage

## Newer Modules Status (Phase 3 Audit)

As noted in requirements, three newer modules were specifically audited:

### 1. **decision_engine/** (NEW)

| Module | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `__init__.py` | 100% | ✅ Pass |
| `action_generator.py` | 100% | ✅ Pass |
| `classification.py` | 73% | ⚠️ Needs Phase 4 expansion |
| `engine.py` | 94% | ✅ Good |
| `policy.py` | 68% | ⚠️ Below threshold; Phase 4 priority |

**Summary:** Decision engine is 87% average — good for new code but `policy.py` needs work.

### 2. **orchestration/** (NEW)

| Module | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `__init__.py` | 100% | ✅ Pass |
| `contracts.py` | 92% | ✅ Strong |
| `engine.py` | 97% | ✅ Excellent |

**Summary:** Orchestration layer is 96% average — **EXCELLENT** for new code.

### 3. **market_memory/** (NEW)

| Module | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `__init__.py` | 100% | ✅ Pass |
| `core.py` | 89% | ✅ Strong |
| `memory.py` | 96% | ✅ Excellent |
| `objects.py` | 100% | ✅ Pass |

**Summary:** Market memory is 96% average — **EXCELLENT** for new code.

## Phase 4 Remediation Roadmap

### Tier 1: Critical (0-30% coverage) — Must Fix

**Priority Order:**

1. **`quant_engine/compatibility.py` (0%, 1047 lines)**
   - Action: Either remove dead code or add comprehensive unit tests
   - Effort: HIGH
   - Timeline: Week 1

2. **`quant_engine/models.py` (0%, 500 lines)**
   - Action: Break into smaller modules; add test suite for each
   - Effort: HIGH
   - Timeline: Week 1-2

3. **`quant_engine/dataset_contracts.py` (0%, 70 lines)**
   - Action: Add contract validation tests
   - Effort: LOW
   - Timeline: 1-2 hours

4. **`machine_learning/{builder,contracts}.py` (0%, 18 lines total)**
   - Action: Add unit tests for ML pipeline initialization
   - Effort: LOW
   - Timeline: 1-2 hours

### Tier 2: High-Risk (30-70% coverage) — Should Fix

**Priority Order:**

1. **`validation/{rules,validators}.py` (35-46%, 192 lines)**

   - Effort: LOW-MEDIUM
   - Timeline: 2 hours

3. **`decision_engine/classification.py` (73%, 274 lines)**
   - Current: Audit for decision logic gaps
   - Action: Test more regime transitions, edge cases
   - Effort: MEDIUM
   - Timeline: 2-3 hours

4. **`quant_engine/technical/validation.py` (73%, 41 lines)**
   - Current: Validation logic undertested
   - Action: Add comprehensive validation tests
   - Effort: LOW
   - Timeline: 1-2 hours

### Tier 3: Enhancement (70-90% coverage) — Nice to Have

**Modules with minor gaps:**

- `quant_engine/historical/analytics.py` (82%) — add edge case tests
- `pipeline/pipeline.py` (89%) — test error paths
- `orchestration/contracts.py` (92%) — test boundary cases

## Test Isolation Status (Phase 3.3 Preview)

**Coverage report does not indicate database isolation issues at coverage level.** Phase 3.3 detailed audit will verify:

- [ ] Direct `researchos.db` references in tests
- [ ] Temporary path fixtures usage
- [ ] Database mock/fixture injection
