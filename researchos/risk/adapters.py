    The adapter deliberately requires the caller to select a directional
    outcome. Neutral is not silently converted into a trade direction, and the
    adapter does not alter, normalize, or manufacture the probability.

    Calibration status is optional and must come from an external
    evidence-backed calibration evaluation. It is therefore passed explicitly
    at this boundary rather than inferred from probability magnitude.

    ``ProbabilityAssessment`` is accepted directly for in-process use or as a
    serialized dictionary for an API-first boundary. When a calibration status
    is explicitly supplied, it takes precedence over serialized metadata;
    otherwise the serialized ``probability_calibration_status`` value is
    preserved.
