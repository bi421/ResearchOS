ResearchOS — Institutional Market Research Platform

A deterministic, explainable, scientific market research platform
that produces institutional-quality research for human traders.

This package implements the ResearchOS constitutional framework
(Articles I-XVII) as a Python library.

Key Principles:
    - Determinism: Every computation is deterministic and reproducible
    - Explainability: Every conclusion has a complete reasoning trace
    - Scientific Rigor: Every hypothesis is falsifiable
    - No Trading: ResearchOS never executes trades or sends orders

Usage:
    from researchos import Research, Observation, Evidence

See: docs/01_VISION.md through docs/17_OBJECT_MODEL.md
